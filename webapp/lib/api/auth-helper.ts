/**
 * 🔥 DIVINE Auth Helper - localStorage as Single Source of Truth
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE:
 * - localStorage = Source of Truth (persisted, reliable)
 * - Zustand = Reactive Cache (UI only, can be empty after refresh)
 *
 * NEVER read from Zustand for API calls - it may be empty!
 * ALWAYS read from localStorage - it's stable across page reloads.
 *
 * Fixes: "Unable to save at the moment" errors caused by race conditions
 * between Zustand hydration and API calls.
